            <h2>What Does BMI Stand For?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>BMI</strong>, or Body Mass Index, is a measure used to assess a person's weight relative to their height. It's calculated by dividing an individual's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. This method provides a straightforward way to gauge whether someone is within a healthy weight range.

            <h2>What Is the Ideal BMI for Men and Women?</h2>
            <p>
                The ideal BMI range for adults, regardless of gender, is typically considered to be between <strong>18.5 and 24.9</strong>. A BMI below 18.5 indicates underweight, while a BMI of 25.0 or higher suggests overweight. Individuals with a BMI of 30.0 or above are classified as obese.
